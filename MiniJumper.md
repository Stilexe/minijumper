# Mini Jumper

Indie video game or indie game, unlike "triple A" games, are video games created by individuals or smaller development teams, often without financial support from a major publisher. The term may also refer to games financed by publishers that do not exercise significant creative control over the developers.
Because of its independence and freedom of development, indie games often focus on innovations and taking risks not usually found in triple-A games, and art games can explore the environment to produce unique experiences. Indie games tend to be sold through digital distribution channels rather than retail, due to lack of publisher support.
